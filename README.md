# Project: Product Authentication and Supply Chain Management System

This project is a web-based solution for **Product Authentication** at the marginal level by consumer and **Supply Chain Management** by manufacturer company. The application enables the administration to release new products and batches of products. Each product contains a unique ID number. Two QR codes will be generated for each product, one for the customer which contains a link to verify the product by visiting verified website of the company and one for the seller which contains a link to mark it as sold when customer wants to buy this. The productâ€™s status and holder information will be updated in the database at each step of the distribution process in the supply chain such as supply to the distributor(wholesaler), distribution to the seller and sale to the customer. The warranty issuing process is automated by this system. When customer buys a product the warranty will be automatically issued. Administration can make data-driven decisions by analyzing data from admin panel.
